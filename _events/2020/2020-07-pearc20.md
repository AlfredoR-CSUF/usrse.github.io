Join us at PEARC20 for a full day workshop focused on Research
Software Engineers.  The workshop will provide an opportunity for
research software engineers to connect in person, share their work,
and contribute to the growth of the community.  There will be
presentations from RSEs about their work and their groups, and about
the development of the RSE community.  We will work together to
identify key tasks for building the research software engineering
community and organize working groups to address these issues after
the conference.

More information will be available as the event nears at the [PEARC20
conference website](https://pearc.acm.org/pearc20/).
