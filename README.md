## The US Research Software Engineer community

The increasing use of digital technologies across research communities has gone hand
in hand with a strong growth and reliance on software written or customized to solve
research problems. This in turn is driving dialog around opportunities to improve 
the development of and incentivize useful sharing, curation and ongoing maintenance of 
research software artefacts and related knowledge.

Of course research software does not develop, curate or maintain itself. Accordingly, 
widespread research software growth has included emerging roles for people who 
create, maintain and contribute to the research software ecosystem. 

Positions like data steward, information manager, research data
officer, research software engineer, research supporter, cyberinfrastructure 
engineer, campus champion, research computing facilitator, bioinformatician and 
other titles are increasingly recognized as core roles in research teams.

Initiatives in the [UK](http://rse.ac.uk/), [Germany](http://www.de-rse.org/de), the 
[Netherlands](http://nl-rse.org)  and elsewhere are exploring bringing
together the community of people writing and contributing to research software at
the nationa and international level. In the US this encompasses
universities, laboratories, knowledge institutes, companies and other 
enterprises. This site is part of that effort.

## What is a Research Software Engineer?

Research Software Engineers (RSEs) are professional roles that closely collaborate
with discipline researchers to understand questions they are studying, and then develop
applications and software systems to help address those questions. Many RSEs 
started out as researchers who spent a lot of time developing software to do 
their own research. Others have started as software developers who have developed a 
strong affinity with the research process.

While the RSEs are increasingly valuable to the research community, they
somewhat lack a formal place in the professional academic system. This can create 
challenges around long-term software sustainability, curation and continuity. This
in turn potentially impacts reproducibility of digital insights and results,
that is fundamental to credible research.

The term Research Software Engineer was created as a way to 
catylze more effective professionalization of these roles.
The goal is to mutually benefit the integrity of digital research 
processes, further increase impact of digital approaches, and to 
improve career trajectories of capable practitioners that underpin 
these activities. We are working, together with RSE associations in the
[UK](http://rse.ac.uk/), [Germany](http://www.de-rse.org/de),
the Netherlands [NL](http://nl-rse.org) and elsewhere
to highlight the RSE role, and to connect the
broad RSE community in the US together.
