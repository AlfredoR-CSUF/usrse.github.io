If youâ€™re planning to attend [SC19](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/), there will be many opportunities for RSEs to gather and learn!  There will be two panel discussions and a Birds-of-a-Feather session directly related to Research Software Engineering:
-  Panel: [Developing and Managing Research Software in Universities and National Labs](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/session/?sess=sess299), Tuesday, Nov. 19
-  BOF: [Software Engineering and Reuse in Modeling, Simulation, and Data Analytics for Science and Engineering](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&p=3480&sess=sess341), Wednesday, Nov. 20
-  Panel: [Sustainability of HPC Research Computing: Fostering Career Paths for Facilitators, Research Software Engineers, and Gateway Creators](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&p=3479&id=pan109&sess=sess227), Thursday, Nov. 21

US-RSE and UK-RSE leaders will be involved in these sessions as leaders and panelists.

Several additional sessions may be of interest to RSEs:
-  Tutorial: [Floating-Point Analysis and Reproducibility Tools for Scientific Software](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&p=3479&id=tut139&sess=sess205), Sunday, Nov. 17
-  Workshop: [The 2019 International Workshop on Software Engineering for HPC-Enabled Research (SE-HER 2019)](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&p=3480&sess=sess106), Sunday, Nov. 17
-  Tutorial: [Better Scientific Software](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&p=3479&id=tut158&sess=sess192), Monday, Nov. 18
-  Tutorial: [Managing HPC Software Complexity with Spack](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&p=3479&id=tut164&sess=sess194), Monday, Nov. 18
-  Workshop: [3nd International Workshop on Software Correctness for HPC Applications (Correctness 2019)](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&p=3480&sess=sess118), Monday, Nov. 18
-  Students@SC: [Modern Software Design, Tools, and Practices](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&p=3479&id=pec109&sess=sess410), Monday, Nov. 18
-  BOF: [Extreme-Scale Scientific Software Stack (E4S)](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&p=3480&sess=sess269), Tuesday, Nov. 19
-  BOF: [Ask.CI, the Q&A Platform for Research Computing - Recent Developments](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/session/?sess=sess274), Tuesday, Nov. 19
-  BOF: [Exchanging Best Practices in Supporting Computational and Data-Intensive Research](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/session/?sess=sess266), Tuesday, Nov. 19
-  BOF: [Getting Scientific Software Installed](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&p=3479&id=pan108&sess=sess226), Wednesday, Nov. 20
-  BOF: [Quality Assurance and Coding Standards for Parallel Software](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&p=3480&sess=sess316), Thursday, Nov. 21
-  Panel: [The Road to Exascale and Beyond is Paved by Software: How Algorithms, Libraries and Tools Will Make Exascale Performance Real](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/?post_type=page&p=3479&id=pan117&sess=sess232), Friday, Nov. 22

Finally, we're also planning to arrange an informal RSE gathering (or more than one?) during the conference - details are TBA.  We hope to see you there!

(See the [SC19 website](https://sc19.supercomputing.org/) for more details.  Note that schedules are subject to last-minute changes.  Thanks to Sandra Gesing and Dan Katz; their URSSI newsletter article provided several of the items on this list.)
