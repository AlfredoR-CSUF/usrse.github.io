At the Digital Humanities Conference 2019 in Utrecht, a group of Digital Humanities (DH) RSEs came together for a workshop about building a community of DH RSEs. The discussion covered many different aspects and issues from recognition and career paths to funding and community building. The result of the workshop is a white paper addressing some of the concerns most DH RSEs share. It is meant as a call for DH RSEs to connect with each other and to draw attention to their needs as they are a crucial part of most DH projects. As a starting point for a community, the workshop participants chose [DHTech](https://dh-tech.github.io/), a group of Digital Humanities RSEs that was started two years earlier at DH2017.
